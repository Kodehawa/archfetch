# Arch Fetch
Simple Arch Linux fetch script.

This fetch script should run fast, as it's made to be used with every console instance opened.
Keep in mind it only works on Arch Linux, but you can modify it to use it on any distro (Just change the pkg, ex_pkg and aur_pkg to match your distro and the appropiate string).

The memory code comes from (pfetch)[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pfetch], thanks!


Dependencies: 
* Dash. You can get around this by changing #!/bin/dash to #!/bin/bash at the start, though.

Thanks to: 
* pfetch
